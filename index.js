//parseInt is important so that string will turn into number

//we need to show the user visual information

//we can use pokeID not only to write the URL, but also to read the array since it matches the json file's index!
//therefore inside contentsOfFile, we type a '.' which acts like a 'cd' in command line to read deeper into the array
//.pokemon is the name of the array
//.pokemon[pokeID] is the index value within the array
//we define/name all this crap as pokeInfo

    res.render('pokemon', {pokeInfo:pokeInfo})
//now that we got our juicy info, time to RENDER it to browser via response.render
//we can type 'pokemon' as pokemon.jsx is inside the views folder and is uniquely recognised
//{pokeInfo:pokeInfo} kinda syntaxy since {}objects need {key:value} ie:
//{
//x : angelmon
